# Feuerwehreinsätze NÖ - FireService

Web- &amp; mobile app for displaying information about ongoing firefighter operations and statistics of operations in lower austria. The [Grisu NÖ - Mobile App](https://github.com/Grisu-NOE/mobile-app) was used as model.

## Description
This app was developed in the course of my bachelor thesis about reactive programming at the Johannes Kepler University (JKU). 
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
